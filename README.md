LMCipher: Logistic Map Cipher

The logistic map cipher is a simple proof of concept of a cipher that uses the logistic map function.
To use see INSTALL and to compile run 'make'.

The end executable 'lmcipher' can be used to encrypt files using a given key. The bigger the key the better the security.

Disclaimer 
===========

Under no circumstances should this be considered a viable security solution, this is a research project.
I will not assume responsibility for bugs that could lead to weaker security. Use at own risk.
